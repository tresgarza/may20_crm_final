## Project Overview

Fincentiva CRM is a comprehensive credit/loan management system designed to track and process credit applications. The application allows for managing clients, processing loan applications, and tracking the status of applications through various stages of approval.

The system supports multiple user roles (advisors and company administrators) with different permissions and views. It includes dashboards with metrics and visualization tools to help track performance and application status.

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **State Management**: React Context
- **Routing**: React Router
- **API Communication**: Fetch API with custom handlers

## Architecture

The application follows a modern React architecture with the following key components:

### Frontend Structure
- **Pages**: Contains main application views (Applications, Clients, Dashboard, etc.)
- **Components**: Reusable UI components and page-specific components
- **Contexts**: React Context providers for state management (Auth, Permissions)
- **Services**: API communication and business logic
- **Utils**: Helper functions, constants, and utilities

### Backend Structure
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with RESTful API
- **Custom Middleware**: Node.js server for enhanced SQL query handling
- **Tables**: Applications, Clients, Companies, Users, etc.
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom roles and permissions

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with UI components
2. Components trigger actions (service calls)
3. Services make API requests to Supabase directly or through custom middleware
4. Data is processed and stored in the database
5. UI updates with new data

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Vercel account
- Supabase account with a project set up

### Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository

1. Make sure your code is in the correct branch on GitHub
   - Currently the working branch is: `working-apr29-DONOTDELETE`
   - This branch contains all fixed issues and latest working code

2. Ensure your GitHub repository is public or Vercel has access to it
   - If it's a private repository, you'll need to give Vercel access during setup

### Step 2: Set Up Supabase Project

1. Log in to your Supabase account at https://app.supabase.io/
2. Create a new project if you don't have one already
   - Give it a name (e.g., "fincentiva-crm-production")
   - Choose a password for the database
   - Select a region closest to your users

3. Get your Supabase credentials:
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ API
   - You'll need:
     - **Project URL** (e.g., https://ydnygntfkrleiseuciwq.supabase.co)
     - **anon** public key 
     - **service_role** key (keep this very secure!)

4. Set up the database schema:
   - Go to the SQL Editor in Supabase
   - You'll need to create the necessary tables. Your project likely has SQL migrations that can be run here.
   - At minimum, you'll need tables for:
     - users
     - clients
     - applications
     - companies
     - documents
     - application_history

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account at https://vercel.com/
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
   - Find your repository in the list
   - If you don't see it, you may need to configure Vercel to access your GitHub account

4. Configure the project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Select "Create React App"
   - **Build and Output Settings**: Use the defaults (Build command: `npm run build`)
   - **Environment Variables**: This is very important! Add these variables:
     ```
     REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
     REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URL=your_api_server_url (if using custom middleware)
     ```

5. Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy your application
   - This might take a few minutes

### Step 4: Set Up Custom API Server (if needed)

If your project uses the custom middleware server (supabase-mcp-server.js), you'll need to deploy it separately:

1. Create a new Node.js project on Vercel or another hosting provider
2. Deploy only the server file and its dependencies
3. Set the `REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URL` in your frontend project to point to this server

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Your application needs these environment variables to work correctly:

1. In the Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
2. Navigate to the "Environment Variables" section
3. Add the following variables:

   ```
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

   If you're using the custom API server:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URL=https://your-api-server-url
   ```

### Step 6: Set Up Continuous Deployment

1. In Vercel, your project should be set up for continuous deployment by default
2. Any commits to your main branch will trigger a new deployment
3. If you want to change this:
   - Go to your project settings in Vercel
   - Navigate to the "Git" section
   - Modify the production branch to match your working branch (`working-apr29-DONOTDELETE`)

### Step 7: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Vercel project settings, go to "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Follow the instructions to configure DNS settings

### Step 8: Test Your Deployment

1. After deployment completes, Vercel will provide you with a URL
2. Visit the URL to make sure your application is working correctly
3. Test all main features:
   - Login
   - Creating applications
   - Viewing dashboards
   - Client management

### Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

**Problem: API requests failing**
- Check that your environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Supabase permissions and policies
- Check CORS settings in Supabase

**Problem: Blank page after deployment**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify that the build process completed successfully
- Check if the correct branch was deployed

**Problem: Login not working**
- Verify Supabase Auth is set up correctly
- Check that environment variables for Supabase are correct
- Ensure your signup/login routes are configured properly

**Problem: Custom API server not connecting**
- Check if the server is deployed and running
- Verify the URL is correct in environment variables
- Check for CORS issues

### Important Notes About the Project

1. **Branch Management**:
   - `working-apr29-DONOTDELETE` contains the latest working version
   - Before making changes, create a new branch from this one
   - Do not delete this branch as it's the stable version

2. **Backend Dependencies**:
   - The project relies on Supabase for data storage and authentication
   - The custom API server (supabase-mcp-server.js) is used for advanced SQL queries

3. **Deployment Frequency**:
   - Plan deployments carefully as they may affect ongoing operations
   - Test thoroughly before deploying to production

4. **Database Structure**:
   - The application has specific database requirements
   - Changes to the database structure require updating the corresponding frontend code

5. **Environment-Specific Configurations**:
   - Development environment may use different settings than production
   - Create separate Supabase projects for development and production if needed
